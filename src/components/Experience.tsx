                        During the second week of classes at CU Boulder I was
                        invited by my computer science professor, Dr. Tom Yeh,
                        to join his laboratory as research assistant intern.

                        The BAIC lab has around ten research projects
                        simultaneously. I am involved with multiple projects; I
                        have highlighted the ones I am most involved with in the
                        Projects section.

                        Poatek, one of the WillowTree branches, is an IT
                        boutique based in Brazil, with high-end clients from all

                        <br />
                        During the year I worked there, I mostly worked with an
                        asset management firm from Florida as a full stack
                        software engineer. Among my accomplishments, a few that
                        are worth mentioning are:
                        <br />

                        <List>
                            <li>
                                Implemented a new dashboard used by the whole
                                user-base in a daily basis;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Developed multiple high-performance endpoints in
                                NodeJS to handle both user transactions and
                                internal tools;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Created an AWS Lambda with Kotlin to parse and
                                evaluate XLSX files with custom wrote XIRR
                                calculations, using the XLSX itself as the CPU,
                                making complex estimated returns calculations
                                simple;

                            <li>
                                Wrote an utterly new signature flow using
                                DocuSign APIs, facilitating the signing and
                                document fetching process, making a weekâ€™s worth
                                of work manual labor automatic;

                                Developed multiple successful POCs using
                                different languages and frameworks, saving the
                                team valuable time when evaluating new ideas;

                        Stockvio is a platform where users can automatically
                        calculate their taxes over capital gains in BOVESPA
                        using only their trading receipts.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When I started investing in the Brazilian stock market
                        back in 2020, I realized how complicated, tedious, and
                        error-prone the process to calculate taxes over capital
                        gains was.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        With this in mind, I designed a software to automate the
                        whole process, only using the trading receipts provided
                        by the investor&rsquo;s brokerage. A few of my
                        responsibilities within the company were:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <List>
                            <li>
                                Implemented the first version of the parsing and
                                calculation algorithm;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Handled day-to-day operations & business logic;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Assisted the coordination of the development
                                team with the CTO;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Developed the majority of the frontend with
                                NextJS and multiple endpoints using NestJS &
                                PostgreSQL;
                            </li>
